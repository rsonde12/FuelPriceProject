## Note to our instructional teacher assistant and grader:
To run our front-end application, please open the terminal and run the following command:

```
npm start
```
If the above command does not work, run the following command before re-running the above:

```
npm i express nodemon ejs express-session body-parser uuid
```

You will then recieve the following output:
```
Server started on port localhost:3000
```

Copy only ```localhost:3000``` and input into your browser.
