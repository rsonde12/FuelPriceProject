## Note to our instructional teacher assistant and grader:
To run our front-end application, please open the terminal and run the following command:

```
npm start
```

You will then recieve the following output in your terminal:
```
Server started on port localhost:3000
```

Hold the ctrl key and click on ```localhost:3000``` which should automatically launch the url in your browser.
